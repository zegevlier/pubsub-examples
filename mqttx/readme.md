# Connecting to Cloudflare Pub/Sub via MQTTX

This is basically just a list of what the configuration options should be

- Name: Anything you want
- Client ID: This cannot be kept empty, so it must be the ID of the token you are using. This is in the shape of `<broker name><27 seemingly random characters, all uppercase>`. This is the value that is stored to the `BROKER_CLIENT_ID` value in the `.env` file generated by `create_required_info.py`
- Host: Select `mqtts://` from the dropdown, then set the host to `<broker_name>.<namespace_name>.cloudflarepubsub.com`. This is the value that is stored to the `PUBSUB_URI` value in the `.env` file generated by `create_required_info.py`. It is the endpoint returned in the API requests, minus the `mqtts://` prefix and the port suffix.
- Port: 8883, this is returned in the endpoint by the API.
- Username: This can be anything you want.
- Password: The token you are using. This is the value that is stored to the `BROKER_TOKEN` value in the `.env` file generated by `create_required_info.py`. It is a JWT token.
- Turn on SSL/TLS, and select CA signed server. Then turn on SSL Secure.
- In the Advanced tab, select MQTT version 5.0.
- All other options are set to their default values.
